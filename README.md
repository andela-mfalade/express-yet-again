# express-yet-again
Back to my first tongue - JS but even better, ES6.. and then some ;)


This is a very basic `express route` built with the new ES6 and compiled using
babel.

---

### Purpose
To get a hang of the new es6 syntax and shipped in functionalities.

#### What I'm building.
So I decided to convert this to a simple app with which you can download Youtube
videos in Mp3 format.

I made use of the youtubeinmp3.com api to achieve this.

You can view this app on [youtubetomp3ly.herokuapp.com](youtubetomp3ly.herokuapp.com)

Cheers!
